# Automated Web Testing with C#, Playwright, and SpecFlow ü§ñüÖ≤#üé≠

This project provides a structure and tools for automated web testing using C#, Playwright, and SpecFlow, following Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) best practices and employing the Page Object Model design pattern.

## Testing demoblaze.com Features üß™

This suite of tests is specifically designed to validate and test features on the [demoblaze.com](https://www.demoblaze.com) website. You'll find feature files under the `Features` directory related to signup, login and adding products to the cart.
